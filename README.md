# Stock_market_prediction
Project for understanding machine learning and trend on stock market using different algorithms of machine learning.


First I will start with a regression to get familiar with technical indicators and intro to machien learning.
Findings: I found out that it is very easy to overfit the model using several technical indicators,
* Using lagged days as features to predict the percent rather then price was better
* Linear Regression is overall not very good for future prediction as stocks are not linear and are affected by many factors.
